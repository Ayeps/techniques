In our module, a normal form game and a player are represented by the classes NormalFormGame and Player, respectively.

A Player carries the player's payoff function and implements in particular a method that returns the best response action(s) given an action of the opponent player, or a profile of actions of the opponents if there are more than one.

A NormalFormGame is in effect a container of Player instances.



```python
matching_pennies_bimatrix = [[(1, -1), (-1, 1)],
                             [(-1, 1), (1, -1)]]
g_MP = gt.NormalFormGame(matching_pennies_bimatrix)

print(g_MP)
print("Player Instance; \n",g_MP.players[1])  # Player instance for player 1
print("Player 1's payoff array\n",g_MP.players[1].payoff_array)  # Player 1's payoff array
print("payoff profile for action profile (0, 0)\n",g_MP[0, 0])  # payoff profile for action profile (0, 0)



```

    2-player NormalFormGame with payoff profile array:
    [[[ 1, -1],  [-1,  1]],
     [[-1,  1],  [ 1, -1]]]
    Player Instance; 
     Player in a 2-player normal form game with payoff array:
    [[-1,  1],
     [ 1, -1]]
    Player 1's payoff array
     [[-1  1]
     [ 1 -1]]
    payoff profile for action profile (0, 0)
     [ 1 -1]


The game_theory module also supports games with more than two players.

Let us consider the following version of N
-player Cournot Game.


```python
from quantecon import cartesian


def cournot(a, c, N, q_grid):
    """
    Create a `NormalFormGame` instance for the symmetric N-player Cournot game
    with linear inverse demand a - Q and constant marginal cost c.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : scalar
        Intercept of the demand curve

    c : scalar
        Common constant marginal cost

    N : scalar(int)
        Number of firms

    q_grid : array_like(scalar)
        Array containing the set of possible quantities

    Returns
    -------
    NormalFormGame
        NormalFormGame instance representing the Cournot game

    """
    q_grid = np.asarray(q_grid)
    payoff_array = \
        cartesian([q_grid]*N).sum(axis=-1).reshape([len(q_grid)]*N) * (-1) + \
        (a - c)
    payoff_array *= q_grid.reshape([len(q_grid)] + [1]*(N-1))
    payoff_array += 0  # To get rid of the minus sign of -0

    player = gt.Player(payoff_array)
    return gt.NormalFormGame([player for i in range(N)])
```

Here's a simple example with three firms, marginal cost 20, and inverse demand function 80âˆ’Q, where the feasible quantity values are assumed to be 10 and 15.


```python


a, c = 80, 20
N = 3
q_grid = [10, 15]  # [1/3 of Monopoly quantity, Nash equilibrium quantity]

g_Cou = cournot(a, c, N, q_grid)


```


```python
print(g_Cou)
```

    3-player NormalFormGame with payoff profile array:
    [[[[300, 300, 300],   [250, 250, 375]],
      [[250, 375, 250],   [200, 300, 300]]],
    
     [[[375, 250, 250],   [300, 200, 300]],
      [[300, 300, 200],   [225, 225, 225]]]]


Finding Nash equilibria

There are several algorithms implemented to compute Nash equilibria:

Brute force
Find all pure-action Nash equilibria of an N player game (if any).
Sequential best response
Find one pure-action Nash equilibrium of an N player game (if any).
Support enumeration
Find all mixed-action Nash equilibria of a two-player nondegenerate game.
Vertex enumeration
Find all mixed-action Nash equilibria of a two-player nondegenerate game.
Lemke-Howson
Find one mixed-action Nash equilibrium of a two-player game.
McLennan-Tourky
Find one mixed-action Nash equilibrium of an N player game.

For more variety of algorithms, one should look at Gambit.

```python
def print_pure_nash_brute(g):
    """
    Print all pure Nash equilibria of a normal form game found by brute force.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    g : NormalFormGame
    
    """
    NEs = gt.pure_nash_brute(g)
    num_NEs = len(NEs)
    if num_NEs == 0:
        msg = 'no pure Nash equilibrium'
    elif num_NEs == 1:
        msg = '1 pure Nash equilibrium:\n{0}'.format(NEs)
    else:

    The game has 1 pure Nash equilibrium:
    [(1, 1, 1)]

A Cournot game with linear demand is known to be a potential game, for which sequential best response converges to a Nash equilibrium.

Let us try a bigger instance:



```python


a, c = 80, 20
N = 3
q_grid = np.linspace(0, a-c, 13)  # [0, 5, 10, ..., 60]
g_Cou = cournot(a, c, N, q_grid)


```


```python
a_star = sequential_best_response(g_Cou)  # By default, start with (0, 0, 0)
print('Nash equilibrium indices: {0}'.format(a_star))
print('Nash equilibrium quantities: {0}'.format(q_grid[a_star]))
```

    init_actions: [0 0 0]
    player 0: [6 0 0]
    player 1: [6 3 0]
    player 2: [6 3 1]
    player 0: [4 3 1]

    Nash equilibrium quantities: [15. 15. 15.]

    True




```python
# In fact, the game has other Nash equilibria (because of our choice of grid points and parameter values):

print_pure_nash_brute(g_Cou)
```

    The game has 7 pure Nash equilibria:
    [(2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 3), (3, 2, 4), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 2), (4, 2, 3), (4, 3, 2)]




Next, let us study the All-Pay Acution, where, unlike standard auctions, bidders pay their bids regardless of whether or not they win. Situations modeled as all-pay auctions include job promotion, R&D, and rent seeking competitions, among others.

Here we consider a version of All-Pay Auction with complete information, symmetric bidders, discrete bids, bid caps, and "full dissipation" (where the prize is materialized if and only if there is only one bidder who makes a highest bid).



```python
from numba import jit

    Create a `NormalFormGame` instance for the symmetric N-player
    All-Pay Auction game with common reward `r` and common bid cap `e`.

        Common reward value.

    c : scalar(int)

    N : scalar(int)
        Number of players.

    dissipation : bool, optional(default=True)
        If True, the prize fully dissipates in case of a tie. If False,
        the prize is equally split among the highest bidders (or given
        to one of the highest bidders with equal probabilities).
