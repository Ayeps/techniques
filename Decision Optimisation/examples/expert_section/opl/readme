Once Python is installed, install the latest version of ticdat using the command 
   'pip install ticdat'
If you already have ticdat, but want to upgrade to the most recent version
   'pip install ticdat â€”upgrade'

After that, use the command line to navigate to the directory containing the oplrun executable. 

In this video that directory is C:\Program Files\IBM\CPLEX_Studio_Community127\opl\bin\x64_win64

Then from this directory, run the oplrun_setup.py file found at http://bit.ly/2sEOMUe

Once OPL is connected to Ticdat, navigate to a directory containing the OPL .mod file, 
the associated Python file, and the dataset. This video uses Ticdat's Oil blend example 
http://bit.ly/2rqoWWi.

The oil_blend.mod file has 3 extra lines to communicate with ticdat
     `include "ticdat_oil_blend.mod";`   
        (This includes an file autogenerated by Ticdat which defines the input schema)
     `include "ticdat_oil_blend_output.mod";` 
        (This includes an file autogenerated by Ticdat which defines the output schema)
     `writeOutputToFile();` 
        (This line tells OPL to output the solution in a format able to be read by Ticdat)

The Python file is a light wrapper which defines the input and output schemas, as well as 
providing the option to check data integrity before it gets to OPL.

To run the file, navigate to the folder containing the model using the command line.
Then enter the command `python <python-file> -i <input-data-to-be-used> -o <file-to-output-solution>`
The input and output files can be one of a number of formats, including JSON, SQL, and XLSX 
(you can also import one format and output in another).

Running the OPL model through Ticdat generates a number of intermediate files. 
For the oil-blend example, these are:
   "oil-solution.xlsx" - The solution output in .xlsx format, 
                         which is what was specified when the oil-blend.py was run
   "output.txt" - The console output from running oplrun, this is useful when debugging problems
   "results.dat" - This is the solution output formatted as an OPL .dat file
   "temp.dat" - This is the input data formatted as an OPL .dat file
   "ticdat_oil_blend.mod" - This is a OPL .mod file which defines the input schema
   "ticdat_oil_blend_output.mod" - This is a OPL .mod file which defines the output schema.

These files let you run the OPL model directly through OPL, without using Ticdat. 
For the Oil example this would be done by entering the following from the same directory 
as above:
   `oplrun oil-blend.mod temp.dat`
