    "Hazard analysis involves the proactive identification of possible risks and the estimation of their possible consequences. This consists of identifying hazards that could lead to dangerous situations, analyzing a small number of accidental scenarios that could lead to maximal damage, and designing preventive or protective barriers that prevent unacceptable levels of damage from an accident. Important notions are the plausible worst case scenario and the maximum forseeable loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hazard analysis is a component of the deterministic approach to safety assessment. A conservative point estimate of possible exposure to the risk is compared with a threshold value to determine whether the activity is acceptable. Typically, safety factors or safety margins are used to incorporate uncertainty in the risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic methods for risk assessment are widely used in ecotoxicity, food safety and management of natural hazards such as earthquakes and floods."

    "**System safety** is the application of engineering and management principles, criteria, and techniques to optimize all aspects of safety within the constraints of operational effectiveness, time, and cost. It is a planned, disciplined and systematic approach to preventing or reducing accidents throughout the lifecycle of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important principles applied in system safety include **inherent safety** and **defence in depth** (use of multiple, independent safety barriers).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many things can go wrong on a high-risk industrial facility, leading to an unintended release of hazardous material, an uncontrolled release of energy or some other accidental loss. **Consequence assessment** is a rigorous and methodical examination of the direct undesirable impacts of a loss of containment of material or energy, including fires and explosions. It consists of estimating impacts on people, the environment and the process equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequence assessment has applications in:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the design of new facilities, for instance in suggesting optimal separation distances between units, to avoid domino effects\n",
    "\n",
    "    - risk assessment of a facility to provide input to a safety case\n",

    " Rather than using point values to represent random quantities, as in deterministic approaches (Hazard Models), probabilistic approaches to risk assessment represent each random quantity by a probability distribution. Analysis results are presented as probability distributions, or as selected quantiles of a probability distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The probabilistic approach to risk analysis estimates risk as a function of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the severity — or magnitude — of each consequence\n",
    "    - the likelihood (probability) of the occurrence of each consequence\n",
    "\n",
    "In the safety domain, the consequences and types of events assessed are generally adverse (they represent losses, that we try to avoid). In other areas such as finance, events and their consequences may be either positive (profits) or negative (losses).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences are expressed quantatively (for instance, the number of people potentially injured) and their likelihoods of occurrence are expressed as probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copulæ are an interesting mathematical tool to represent correlations between probability distributions. They can be used to represent complex dependencies in multivariate risk models, when more basic tools such as multivariate gaussian distributions are inappropriate. One commonly used application is sampling from correlated random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate modelling of dependencies between model input variables is a very significant issue in risk models in a number of application areas. For example, an inappropriate (simplifying) assumption of gaussian dependencies between the risk of various financial instruments was one of the factors that led to the global financial crisis of 2008.\n",
    "\n",
    "Illustrations of the concept are provided in finance, where the method first reached prominence. We also show applications in other areas, including insurance, management of natural hazards, and quality management in manufacturing.\n",

    "Once hazards have been identified, their possible consequences assessed and the level of risk has been quantified, the decision-making phase of risk management begins. This seeks to answer the questions What can be done and which options are available? What are the associated tradeoffs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk management involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strategic choices concerning the organization’s (or society’s) risk appetite, and the tradeoffs that people are willing to make between benefits resulting from the hazardous activity and its possible negative consequences. These choices will depend on how risks are perceived and the level of risk aversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Arbitrating between different classes of positive and negative dimensions of risk (costs and benefits related to employment, environmental impacts, profits, health and safety impacts), using decision-support tools such as benefit-cost analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Prioritization of safety investments based on key performance indicators and results of safety audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ensuring that action plans for process safety, occupational safety, physical security, information security, enterprise risks and project risks do not lead to conflicting priorities and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Decisions on the level of residual risk that is acceptable, in the presence of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, and the various risk indicators, monitoring and control activities to put in place throughout a project lifecycle, together with escalation procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Communication and consultation to ensure that early warnings of emerging risks are detected, that stakeholders’ perceptions of the decision impacts are known to decision-makers, and that decisions made are understood.\n",

    "To be effective, risk management must be tightly linked to the overall management of a system. These activities are at the frontier between the organizational responsibilities of risk engineers, risk managers and top management. We focus in this module on a technical approach to these activities; a managerial viewpoint on these topics can be found in most MBA programmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk is not a physical thing: is it really possibly to perceive it? Engineering approaches to estimating risk are based on historical observation of frequencies and consequences. Subjective risk, as analyzed by social scientists, concerns people’s thoughts, beliefs and constructs. The level of perceived risk is a subjective judgment about the state of the world, and is affected by several factors including\n",

    "The term “black swan” was used in 16th century discussions of impossibility (all swans known to Europeans were white). Explorers arriving in Australia discovered a species of swan that is black. The term is now used to refer to events that occur though they had been thought to be impossible. In risk analysis, these are also called “unexampled events” or “outliers”.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are more likely when your risk models include “fat tailed” probability distributions, where extreme events (in the tails of the distribution) have higher probabilities than a normal probability distribution. **Fat-tailed distributions are infrequent in most measures of physical populations**, but can be caused by mechanisms such as preferential attachment in social networks and “winner takes all” mechanisms. They can also be caused by correlation between different risk categories, which lead to systemic risks. The seond is the most likley cause, it is indeed the cause for the financial crises. \n",

    "A preferential attachment process is any of a class of processes in which some quantity, typically some form of wealth or credit, is distributed among a number of individuals or objects according to how much they already have, so that those who are already wealthy receive more than those who are not. \"Preferential attachment\" is only the most recent of many names that have been given to such processes. They are also referred to under the names \"Yule process\", \"cumulative advantage\", \"the rich get richer\", and, less correctly, the \"Matthew effect\". They are also related to Gibrat's law. The principal reason for scientific interest in preferential attachment is that it can, under suitable circumstances, generate power law distributions. "
